adding features including LOB support and batch fetching / streaming
of large query result sets.

Share your feedback at the Oracle Technology Network
[Node.js discussion forum](https://community.oracle.com/community/database/developer-tools/node_js/content)
so we can incorporate any fixes and "must-haves" into a 1.0 release
soon.  Issues with node-oracledb can also be reported
[here](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/issues).

The driver is maintained by Oracle Corp.

The node-oracledb home page is on the
[Oracle Technology Network](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/node_js/index.html).

### Example: Simple SELECT statement implementation in node-oracledb

```javascript
var oracledb = require('oracledb');

oracledb.getConnection(
  {
    user          : "hr",
    password      : "welcome",
    connectString : "localhost/XE"
  },
  function(err, connection)
  {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err.message);
      return;
    }
    connection.execute(
      "SELECT department_id, department_name "
    + "FROM departments "
    + "WHERE department_id = :did",
      [180],
      function(err, result)
      {
        if (err) {
          console.error(err.message);
          return;
        }
        console.log(result.rows);
      });
  });
```

With Oracle's sample HR schema, the output is:

```
[ [ 180, 'Construction' ] ]
```
